    "Suppose that Shila is visiting a zoo for the first time, and she does not know much about animals. While observing various animals, she sees some living in water, some with wings, some living in trees, and some underground. Although she does not precisely know what animals they are, she has observed some similarities and differences. With the similarity she noted, she was able to group various animals, as shown in the figure below.\n",

But unlike classification where we have the true label to guide the model training process, in clustering we do not have the true label to guide or supervise the training. Therefore, clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method."

A data point belongs to a cluster whose centroid is closest to it, i.e. centroid with minimum distance. With partition based clustering, the data shown in the Figure 2(a) can be partitioned as,\n",

    "5. **Grid-Based Clustering:**   \n",
    "Grid-based clustering divides the data space into a discrete space called grids. Then, the density of the data in each grid is used to classify it as noise or cluster. The clusters are then grouped based on neighboring locations to form the region of clusters and empty regions.\n",
